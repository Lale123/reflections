When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- if working on same project on different computers
- if more people work on the same project
- as backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- local changes might be overwritten before they can be commited


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
Forks: clones of GitHub repositories in GitHub; to copy work from other people into my account to work independently on that code
Clones: Copies of a GitHub repository on a local computer or copies of a local repository on the local computer
Branches: Code with the same history; to work on different things simultaneously, several people working on the same code

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
